PLAN OF ACTION

Read jQuery documentation and keep researching certain topics that interest me.
Work for 25 minutes at a time and take 5 minute breaks to increase productivity.
Test whenever is necessary to grasp a concept.

RESEARCH

Great resource found for starting out: http://learn.jquery.com/.
How to download jQuery: http://jquery.com/download/.
jQuery must be included in the script tag as src=jquery.js (or whatever you name it) and it must be in the same directory as the html file.

$(document).ready(function() { // code here } runs the code as soon as the document is ready to be manipulated.

			$("a").click(function(event) {
        		alert(":( Google is better anyway");
   			});  ////This is a click event. When the "a" tag is clicked it shows the alert box.

add event.preventDefault(); to prevent the default action from happening.
