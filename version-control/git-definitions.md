# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is the the act of saving previous versions of a project. It's useful in case you cause a bug and need to go to a previous version of your code in order to fix it. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a version of the main code that you work on. You would use one so multiple people could edit code and then it could be reviewed to make sure it works before merging it with the main code. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is basically a save point in your code. A good commit message is a short and sweet description of what you changed about the code.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when git can see that when you are trying to pull from a repo some changes would be overwritten by the files you are merging.
